working on providing documentation in other formats such as PDF.

Distribution naming scheme:

mbsebbs-1.0.6.tar.bz2
  |     | | |
  |     | | +--------- minor patchlevel
  |     | +----------- minor version
  |     +------------- major version

For FTN-style distribution, the tar archive and FILE_ID.DIZ are
zipped together in a file with an 8.3-style filename like MBSE-106.ZIP.

If you need support, we support MBSE in Fidonet's MBSE echo (this is
our preferred method of support).

A note from MBSE's original author:

"Since 1 August 2013 I (Michiel Broek) stopped developing this package. But
this is a GPL2 licensed open source package so feel free to continue to
improve it.  I only ask to make it clear to others that it is a modified
package. You can do that by changing the version numbers and messages in
the file configure.ac and then run autoconf to update the configure scripts."
